I am a Upper Sixth Wellington College Belfast Student, studying Maths, Further Maths and Computer Science at A-level. 
I also completed Physics AS level, where I achieved an A grade.

I have been a part of the HE+ Program for my Oxbridge UCAS Application. Where I attended online webinars to help me prepare for writing my personal statement and choosing which universities to apply to. Through this, I also received the opportunity to visit Coprus Christi Campus of the University of Cambridge during Summer 2024.

I am currently working on coursework for my computer science A level where I found a business with a system that does not work as inteneded / is very ineficient, and I have to recreate the system without the problems.
